The game of tic tac toe works by placing "X" or "O" on a 3 by 3 board
First one to get a horizontal, vertical or diagonal match wins
What is needed for the project:
    * a function that creates the playing board
        - each box in the board is assigned an object that will hold an empty value to start
    * a function that handles adding an "X" or "O" value
    * a function that handles checking if there is a winner

Implementation:
    - board()
        * this is a module an IFEE function 
        * create()
            - it first creates a 3 by 3 board
            - define constant variables row = 2, column = 2, board = []
            - an outer loop that loops through the rows and an inner loop that loops through the column
            - in the inner loop each board[x][y] will hold a box() function that will handle the values
        * getBoard()
            - an arrow function that returns the created board
        * add()
            - accepts row and column, palyer's token
            - if the row or column doesn't exist it returns 
            - goes to the specified location and checks the value of that box
                    - if the value is not empty it returns
                    - else it adds the value using box.addValue()

    - box()
        * this is a module an IFEE function
        * a variable that has the initial value which is empty 
        * addValue()
            - accepts player token
            - changes the value to that players token
        * value()
            - shows the current value
    - player()
        * this is a module an IFEE function
        * this is an object that has the players name, and token
        * addPlayer()
            - updates the values of name and token
        * token() 
            - arrow function that returns the players token
        * name() 
            - arrow funciton that returns the players name
    - playGame()
        * this is a module an IFEE function
        * first creates the board by calling the board.create()
        * then get's the full board using board.getBoard()
        * nRound()
            - plays through one round 
            - accepts the row and column
            - first creates the two players
                - playerOne = addPlayer("PlayerOne", "X")
                - playerTwo = addPlayer("PlayerTwo", "O")
            - define an active player -> activePlayer = playerOne
            - define hasWon to false
            - roundsPlayed = 1
            - while hasWon doesn't return true
                * add the activePlayer token addValue(row, column, activePlayer.token)
                * hasWon = checkWinner(row, column, activePlayer)
                * activePlayer = activePlayer.token == playerOne.token ? playerTwo : playerOne
                * add one to roundsPlayed
                * if hasWon is true
                    - return "activePlayer.name has won"
                * if roundsPlayed > 10
                    - return "it was a tie"

                

        * checkWinner()
            - accepts player, row, and column
            - a constant direction list that holds the directions to checkin
                * [0, 1] horizontal
                * [1, 0] vertical
                * [1, 1] diagonal right
                * [1, -1] diagonal left
            - an loop that goes through the list of directions
                * initialize match = 1
            - an inner loop that changes between two signs [1, -1]
                * the inner loop has three variables x and y 
                    - x = row + direction[0] * signs
                    - y = column + direction[1] * signs
                * while x and y are inside the bound of the board and their values are equal to the players token
                    - match++
                    - x+= direction[0] * signs
                    - y+= direction[1] * signs
                    - if match == 2 return true
                * return false 

                    0,0 0,1 0,2
                    1,0 1,1 1,2
                    2,0 2,1 2,2

    - display()
        * The UI should look like as follows:
            - A header that says welcome or something fun at the top
            - The main content
                * it should have three divs 
                    - one on the left that displays one player
                        * both players will have their name shown and then their token of choice
                        * Mark  John
                            X     O
                        * A change in background color to show who's turn it is
                    - middle has the the board, restart button, addplayer button, A score card at the top
                        * The round being played
                        * the restart button starts a new game
                        * the add player button adds new player
                            - it opens a dialog box
                            - it accepts the name of the player
                            - it let's the player choose to be x or O
                                * if the player is the first player they can choose which ever
                                * else the choice is not shown
                        * the board shows the game
                            - it changes the background color of the boxes that have the winning line
                    - one on the right that displays the second player
                        * same as what was done on the left
                *
